We have lots of information about the demographics and financial information of targeted users, as well as information about when the potential customer was contacted. Our goal is to uncover patterns in the data, allowing the bank to more effectively choose who to contact, which hopefully in the future will lead to a higher percentage of customers successfully converted (in future campaigns)."
